# Hyperbee Expression Optimizers

The Hyperbee Expression Optimizers are a set of modular expression tree optimizers designed to simplify and enhance the performance of expression trees. Each optimizer addresses a specific category of optimizations, such as simplifying expressions, removing dead code, or reducing memory usage.

## Usage

To optimize an expression tree, configure an `OptimizationOptions` instance to specify which optimizations to enable. Then, use the `Optimizer` class to apply the selected optimizations to your expression tree.

```csharp
var options = new OptimizationOptions
{
    EnableConstantSimplification = true,
    EnableInlining = true,
    EnableControlFlowSimplification = true,
    // Enable other optimizations as needed
};

var optimizer = new Optimizer( options );
var optimizedExpression = optimizer.Optimize( originalExpression );
```

## Optimizers

### ConstantSimplificationOptimizer

**Category**: Expression Simplification

**Description**: This optimizer performs constant folding and constant propagation. It evaluates constant expressions at compile-time, replacing expressions like `2 + 3` with `5`. Constant values are propagated, replacing variables with their known values.

**Benefits**:
- Reduces runtime computation by evaluating constants ahead of time.
- Simplifies the expression tree, which can lead to better performance in later optimizations.

### InliningOptimizer

**Category**: Expression Simplification

**Description**: This optimizer inlines function calls and conditional expressions. It removes lambda expressions by replacing them with their bodies and applies boolean short-circuiting (e.g., `x && true` simplifies to `x`). 

**Benefits**:
- Removes unnecessary function calls and conditionals, simplifying control flow.
- Reduces branching, which improves performance and readability.

### ControlFlowSimplificationOptimizer

**Category**: Control Flow Optimization

**Description**: This optimizer simplifies control flow by removing dead code and unreachable branches. It removes unnecessary conditionals with constant values, unreachable code after `goto` or `throw`, and loops with constant-false conditions.

**Benefits**:
- Reduces the depth and complexity of control flow statements, improving readability and performance.
- Removes branches that will never execute, minimizing the overall expression tree size.

### VariableOptimizationOptimizer

**Category**: Variable Optimization

**Description**: This optimizer inlines single-use variables and eliminates redundant assignments. It also removes unused variables and skips repeated assignments to the same variable.

**Benefits**:
- Reduces memory usage by eliminating unnecessary variables and assignments.
- Simplifies variable management, leading to cleaner and more efficient code.

### StructuralSimplificationOptimizer

**Category**: Structural Simplification

**Description**: This optimizer flattens nested `BlockExpression` nodes, consolidating expressions into a single block where possible. It removes redundant `BlockExpression` nodes, simplifying the overall structure of the expression tree.

**Benefits**:
- Reduces unnecessary nesting, making the expression tree easier to traverse and understand.
- Improves performance by reducing the complexity of nested structures.

### FlowControlOptimizationOptimizer

**Category**: Control Flow Optimization

**Description**: This optimizer removes unused `Label` and `Goto` expressions, as well as empty `TryCatch` and `TryFinally` blocks. It also eliminates unreferenced labels and unused `Goto` targets.

**Benefits**:
- Reduces unnecessary jumps and control flow structures, making the tree cleaner.
- Optimizes error-handling structures to be more efficient.

### ExpressionCachingOptimizer

**Category**: Performance Optimization

**Description**: This optimizer caches repeated sub-expressions by introducing a variable to store the result of each unique sub-expression. It replaces repeated instances with the cached variable, avoiding redundant evaluations.

**Benefits**:
- Improves performance by reducing redundant computations.
- Efficiently handles frequently used sub-expressions in complex expression trees.

### ExpressionSimplificationOptimizer

**Category**: Expression Simplification

**Description**: This optimizer simplifies arithmetic expressions and combines adjacent expressions. It eliminates trivial operations like `x + 0` or `x * 1` and merges sequential expressions.

**Benefits**:
- Reduces the number of operations in the expression tree, making it more efficient.
- Simplifies arithmetic for better readability and performance.

### AccessSimplificationOptimizer

**Category**: Access Optimization

**Description**: This optimizer removes unnecessary null propagation checks (e.g., `null ?? x`) and simplifies array or list indexing with constant values.

**Benefits**:
- Improves performance by reducing redundant null checks.
- Simplifies constant indexing, making the expression tree cleaner and easier to read.

### MemoryOptimizationOptimizer

**Category**: Memory Optimization

**Description**: This optimizer reuses parameters, removes unused temporary variables, and consolidates variable declarations. It pools common parameters and eliminates unused variables to optimize memory usage.

**Benefits**:
- Reduces memory overhead by managing variable usage more efficiently.
- Ensures the expression tree is memory-efficient, which can improve performance in memory-constrained environments.

---

Each optimizer can be selectively enabled or disabled in the `OptimizationOptions` configuration, allowing you to tailor the optimization process based on your performance needs and the complexity of your expression trees. By applying these optimizations, you can make expression trees faster, simpler, and more efficient.
