# Structural Reduction Optimizer
The **Structural Reduction Optimizer** removes unreachable code and consolidates nested or redundant constructs.

## **Purpose**
- **Issue**: Control flow structures can introduce unnecessary branching and redundant constructs, increasing overhead.
- **Solution**: Simplifies control flow by removing dead branches, collapsing nested blocks, and optimizing loops.
- **Result**: Streamlined execution paths with reduced branching and improved readability.

## **Usage Example**
### **Before Optimization**
```csharp
.Lambda #Lambda1<System.Func<int>> {
    .IfThenElse(
        .Constant(true),
        .Constant(42),
        .Constant(0)
    )
}
```

### **After Optimization**
```csharp
.Lambda #Lambda1<System.Func<int>> {
    .Constant(42)
}
```
