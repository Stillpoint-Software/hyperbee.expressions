# Overview of Expression Optimization

Expression optimization enhances the execution of expression trees by reducing redundancies, simplifying constructs, 
and eliminating unnecessary computations. By restructuring and minimizing expression complexity, optimizations 
improve runtime performance and reduce memory usage.

## Optimization Categories

Optimizations generally address one fo four categories of expression tree elements:

### Structural Optimization
   
Simplifies control flow structures like loops, conditionals, and blocks.

   - **How**: Removes unreachable code and consolidates nested blocks.
   - **Why**: Flattening nested blocks into a single sequence reduces interpreter overhead.

### Expression-Level Optimization
   
Optimizes arithmetic, logical, and constant expressions.
   
   - **How**: Eliminates trivial operations, such as adding zero or multiplying by one, and precomputes constant results.
   - **Why**: Folding constants reduces evaluation costs at runtime.

### Inlining and Binding
   
Inlines variables, constants, and member accesses to reduce overhead and memory usage.

   - **How**: Eliminates temporary variables and simplifies bindings.
   - **Why**: Replacing a single-use variable with its value directly reduces allocation and access overhead.

### Subexpression Caching
   
Identifies and caches reusable subexpressions to minimize repeated computations.
 
   - **How**: Prevents redundant evaluation of identical subexpressions in complex trees.
   - **Why**: Storing the result of a reused subexpression in a temporary variable minimizes redundant computation.
