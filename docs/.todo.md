## Work to be done

- Investigate alternative StateMachine implementation that would allow us to use a struct instead of a class for the state machine.
- Add support for local variables that do not need to be part of StateMachine.

- Find/Document known limitations
  - Unsupported `Await` in SwitchCase TestValues
  - Unsupported `Await` in Finally blocks
