# Things TODO

## Work to be done

- Investigate alternative StateMachine implementation that would allow us to use a struct instead of a class for the state machine.
- Custom awaiter support.
- Add Support for Blocks (and other expressions) returning values.
- Debug writer for Transitions
- Add support for local variables that do not need to be part of StateMachine.
- Increase test coverage.
  - Make LoweringVisitor tests assert something.
