# Things TODO

## Work to be done

- Investigate alternative StateMachine implementation that would allow us to use a struct instead of a class for the state machine.
- Investigate replacing StateNode structure with 'pure' expressions.
- Custom awaiter support.
- Increase test coverage.
  - Make LoweringVisitor tests assert something.
