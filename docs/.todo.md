# Things TODO

## State-machine generation
  - Can we identify and avoid flattening structures where there is no await?

## State machine fields
  - Are we over adding fields to the StateMachine?
  - Look into shared Exceptions objects
  - Add shared awaiters based on common types

## Documentation 
- Find/Document known limitations
  - Unsupported `Await` in SwitchCase TestValues
  - Unsupported `Await` in Finally blocks
